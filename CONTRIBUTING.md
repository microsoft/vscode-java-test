## Contributing Fixes
If you are interested in writing code to fix issues, please check the following content to see how to set up the developing environment.

### Overview
The extension has three major modules, which are listed as follow:
- The extension client written in TypeScript - UI logic mostly
- [The Java Language Server plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-java-test/tree/master/java-extension/com.microsoft.java.test.plugin) written in Java - Inspect the Java project 
- [The Java Test Runner](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-java-test/tree/master/java-extension/com.microsoft.java.test.runner) written in Java - An executable jar to running the test cases

### Setup
1. Fork and clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:Microsoft/vscode-java-test.git`
2. `cd vscode-java-test`
3. Install the node dependencies: `npm install`
4. Build the Java modules: `npm run build-plugin`
> Note: The below steps are only required if you want to debug the Java Language Server plugin
5. Import `java-extension/com.microsoft.java.test.plugin` in Eclipse
6. Click `Window` > `Preferences` > `Plug-in Development` > `Target Platform`
7. In the `Target definitions` panel, select `JDTLS.EXT - /com.microsoft.java.test.plugin/target.target`
8. Click `Apply and Close`

### Debugging the Extension Client
1. Open the base directory of Java Test Runner in VS Code
2. Hit `F5` to launch the extension in debug mode
 
### Debugging the Java Language Server plugin
1. In Eclipse, create a new `Debug Configurations`, select the type as `Remote Java Application`
2. In the `Connect` panel, find the `Port` setting in `Connection Properties` and set it to `1044`
3. In the `Source` panel, click `Add` > `Java Project`, select `com.microsoft.java.test.plugin` and click `OK`
4. Click `Apply` to save the configurations
5. Click `Debug` to start the debug session

### Debugging the Java Test Runner
- The Java Test Runner is a normal Maven project, you can open it with whatever the development tools you prefer, for example, VS Code
- The Java Test Runner is an executable jar, the main class is `com.microsoft.java.test.runner.Launcher`
